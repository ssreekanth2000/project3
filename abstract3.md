### Building machine learning models to understand what gives concrete its strength.

The confidence in the United States government is at its peak, especially in young people.This is correlated with multiple factors including high confidence among democrats, rising confidence in the press and falling inflation adjusted incomes. Using data from the GSS data set, I visualize these trends for various age demographics through the years and the then build a regression model to estimate the confidence in the federal government. As of 2016, a democrat aged 22, making $20,000 a year with a high confidence in the press would have the highest amount of the confidence in the government(over 40% higher than someone aged 50 making 50k a year).

Concrete is the world's most widely used material and has been around for centuries we still do not understand exactly how strong it will turn out after pouring a mixture because how non linear its behaviour is. Using data from the UCI machine learning repository, I have built machine learning models to predict it and then evaluated their performance. A linear regression model was almost 50% more inaccurate compared to neural network suggesting the non-linearity of the connections.
