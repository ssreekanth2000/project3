### Building machine learning models to understand what gives concrete its strength.

Sreekanth Sajjala


Concrete is the world's most widely used material and has been around for centuries but we still do not understand exactly how strong it will turn out, after pouring a mixture, because of how non-linear its behaviour is. Using data from the UCI machine learning repository, I have built machine learning models that predict the compressive strength of a mixture of concrete from its composition and then evaluated their performance. A linear regression model was almost 50% more inaccurate compared to neural network suggesting the non-linearity of the connections.
