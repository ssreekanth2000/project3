### Concrete strength analysis


Sreekanth Reddy Sajjala



Machine learning's usage in industries is something that seemed interesting to me. I am exploring how the compressive strength of concrete changes with composition of it. Concrete is made from cement, flyash(additive), slag(additive), aggregates, water and sometimes superplasticizers. I shall be looking into how varying quantities of these would effect the compressive strength of concrete. I would be looking into questions like:-

1. Does the amount of water have an effect?

2. How do compressive strengths vary with time?

3. What is the ideal % of each of the ingredients?


I shall be using regression and possibly neural nets.


I am planning to use a database UC Irvine has compiled.
